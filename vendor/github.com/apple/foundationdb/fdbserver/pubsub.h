 * ///////////////
 * General FDB data model of Pub/Sub model
 * Feeds, Inboxes, Messages
 *
 * Message - publisher (feed), data
 *
 * Inbox - message cache, dirty list, list of subscribed-to feeds
 *
 * Feed - messages, list of inboxes to notify
 *
 * Structures for scalability: global list of dispatching feeds, feeds to consider
 *  dirty for all operation
 *
 * ///////////////
 * Basic Processes: post message, list messages
 *
 * Post (in one transaction):
 *  1. Add message to list of message in feed history
 *  2. For each Inbox of list of watching inboxes
 *    a. remove Inbox from list of watchers
 *    b. mark self as 'dirty' in the Inbox's dirty list
 *
 * List recent message in Inbox (in one transaction), up to n messages:
 *  1. For each dirty Feed, update cache with latest message
 *  2. Triage list by getting latest m messages from top m feeds
 *    note: these messages can be cached in memory on the server, and on paging
 *     operations reused, so long as step 1 is repeated, IF there is no message deletion.
 *
 * ////////////////
 * Assumptions:
 *  1. Subscriptions are "retroactive".  If a subscription is in place, the messages
 *    from that feed will start to appear in the listing of that inboxes messages
 *    and appear in historical lists as well.  This could lead to odd behaviour
 *    if paging through the contents of an inbox while a new subscrption was added
