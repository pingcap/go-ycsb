# go-ycsb 

go-ycsb is a Go port of [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB). It fully supports all YCSB generators and the Core workload so we can do the basic CRUD benchmarks with Go.

## Getting Started

git clone github.com/pingcap/go-ycsb $GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/go-ycsb
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pingcap/go-ycsb
make

./bin/go-ycsb
```

## Usage 

Mostly, we can start from the offical document [Running-a-Workload](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB/wiki/Running-a-Workload).
